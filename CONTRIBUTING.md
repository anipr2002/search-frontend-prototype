## Version Control and Git Flow

Whenever you encounter a :beetle: **bug** or have :tada: **feature request**,
report this via [Github issues](TODO: Link to issues).

We are happy to receive contributions to **Quick-Surf** in the form of **pull requests** via Github.
Feel free to fork the repository, implement your changes and create a merge request to the `develop` branch.
There is a [forking guide](#forking) available to get you started!

### Branching Guidelines
The development follows a simplified version of **git-flow**: The `main` branch always contains stable code.
New features and bug fixes are implemented in `feature/*` or `fix/*` branches and are merged to `develop` once they are finished.
When a new milestone is reached, the content of `develop` will be merged to `main` and a tag is created.

[Github Actions](TODO: Link to actions) are used for continuous integration.
All pull requests and pushes to `main` and `develop` are built automatically.

### Git Commit Messages
Commits should start with a Capital letter and should be written in present tense (e.g. __:tada: Add cool new feature__ instead of __:tada: Added cool new feature__).
It's a great idea to start the commit message with an applicable emoji. This does not only look great but also makes you rethink what to add to a commit.
* :tada: `:tada:` when adding a cool new feature
* :wrench: `:wrench:` when refactoring / improving a small piece of code
* :hammer: `:hammer:` when refactoring / improving large parts of the code
* :sparkles: `:sparkles:` when formatting code
* :art: `:art:` improving / adding assets like textures or images
* :rocket: `:rocket:` when improving performance
* :memo: `:memo:` when writing docs
* :beetle: `:beetle:` when fixing a bug
* :green_heart: `:green_heart:` when fixing the CI build
* :heavy_check_mark: `:heavy_check_mark:` when working on tests
* :arrow_up_small: `:arrow_up_small:` when adding / upgrading dependencies
* :arrow_down_small: `:arrow_down_small:` when removing / downgrading dependencies
* :twisted_rightwards_arrows: `:twisted_rightwards_arrows:` when merging branches
* :fire: `:fire:` when removing files
* :truck: `:truck:` when moving / renaming files or namespaces

### Forking
This is pretty straight-forward. Just click the **Fork** button on the top right of this page. 
Then clone the forked repository, perform your changes, push to a feature branch and create a pull request to the develop branch.

``` bash
git clone git@github.com:<your user name>/<project name>.git
cd <project name>
git remote add upstream git@github.com:<user/organization>/<project name>.git
git checkout develop

git checkout -b feature/your-new-feature
# or
git checkout -b fix/your-bugfix

# ... do and commit your changes!

git push origin feature/your-new-feature
```

When there were changes in the develop branch, you will need to merge those to your fork before creating a pull request:

``` bash
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/develop
```

Then you can create a pull request on GitHub to the develop branch.

## Development

Refer [ðŸš€Quick Start](/README.md#ðŸš€quick-start) for setting up the Project.

### Requirements

> [!TIP]
> See the [README.md](./README.md#requirements). Maybe add some further requirements only for contributers here.

### Style Guide

We use an automatic code formatter called Prettier. Run npm prettier after making any changes to the code.

Then, React's linter will catch most issues that may exist in your code. You can check the status of your code styling by simply running npm linc.

However, there are still some styles that the linter cannot pick up. If you are unsure about something, looking at [Airbnbâ€™s Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) will guide you in the right direction.

### Development Builds

> [!TIP]
> Give some hints for developers how they can build the software more efficiently during development. Maybe give examples of flags that disable optimizations or scripts that enable hot module reloading.

### Test Cases

> [!TIP]
> Give information about your testing strategy. How to name tests and how to organize them. Maybe also give hints about the complexity of tests and which scope they should test.

### Documentation

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Add meaningful documentation to all classes, functions and fields. Try to be complete, but concise. Don't comment with redudant information like: `int counter; // the counter`.
